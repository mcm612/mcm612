workflows**

  I'm driven and passionate about front-end development and design, now
  **leveraging AI to build better software faster**. Experience in developing
   web applications with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, and
  Redux.js, enhanced by **AI-assisted architecture and rapid prototyping**.
